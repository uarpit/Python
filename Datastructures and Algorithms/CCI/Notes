Timecomplexity - Python objects:
    https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity

len function:
    Objects keep track of their own length. The time to extract the length is small O(1)

- Function to convert char to ascii value is ord()
- Delete a key from python dictionary 
 i) del dict[key]
 ii) dict.pop(key) - this will return the value
- To check if the key return a value use get method
  dict.get('x',0) return 0 as defaul value if key is not found.
  If you just give dict.get('x') then it will have None as default value
 
 Note: Cannot run these during an iteration as the dictionary size change is not acceptable during an iteration (in for loop)
 
- range function to get in reverse goes like this - range(high,low,-1)

- Usally during the function calls default behaviour in python is copy by referece

- zip function in python lets us iterate on two lists symultaniously 


Bit Manipulation:
XOR = subtract (behaves like modulus)
